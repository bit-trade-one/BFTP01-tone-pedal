    USB Device header file

Summary:
    This file, with its associated C source file, provides the main substance of
    the USB device side stack.  These files will receive, transmit, and process
    various USB commands as well as take action when required for various events
    that occur on the bus.

Description:
    This file, with its associated C source file, provides the main substance of
    the USB device side stack.  These files will receive, transmit, and process
    various USB commands as well as take action when required for various events
    that occur on the bus.

    This file is located in the "\<Install Directory\>\\Microchip\\Include\\USB"
    directory.
    
    When including this file in a new project, this file can either be
    referenced from the directory in which it was installed or copied
    directly into the user application folder. If the first method is
    chosen to keep the file located in the folder in which it is installed
    then include paths need to be added so that the library and the
    application both know where to reference each others files. If the
    application folder is located in the same folder as the Microchip
    folder (like the current demo folders), then the following include
    paths need to be added to the application's project:
    
    ..\\..\\Microchip\\Include

    .
    
    If a different directory structure is used, modify the paths as
    required. An example using absolute paths instead of relative paths
    would be the following:
    
    C:\\Microchip Solutions\\Microchip\\Include
    
    C:\\Microchip Solutions\\My Demo Application

  Summary:
    This function indicates if remote wakeup has been enabled by the host.
    Devices that support remote wakeup should use this function to
    determine if it should send a remote wakeup.

  Description:
    This function indicates if remote wakeup has been enabled by the host.
    Devices that support remote wakeup should use this function to
    determine if it should send a remote wakeup.
    
    If a device does not support remote wakeup (the Remote wakeup bit, bit
    5, of the bmAttributes field of the Configuration descriptor is set to
    1), then it should not send a remote wakeup command to the PC and this
    function is not of any use to the device. If a device does support
    remote wakeup then it should use this function as described below.
    
    If this function returns FALSE and the device is suspended, it should
    not issue a remote wakeup (resume).
    
    If this function returns TRUE and the device is suspended, it should
    issue a remote wakeup (resume).
    
    A device can add remote wakeup support by having the _RWU symbol added
    in the configuration descriptor (located in the usb_descriptors.c file
    in the project). This done in the 8th byte of the configuration
    descriptor. For example:

    <code lang="c">
    ROM BYTE configDescriptor1[]={
        0x09,                           // Size 
        USB_DESCRIPTOR_CONFIGURATION,   // descriptor type 
        DESC_CONFIG_WORD(0x0022),       // Total length 
        1,                              // Number of interfaces 
        1,                              // Index value of this cfg 
        0,                              // Configuration string index 
        _DEFAULT | _SELF | _RWU,        // Attributes, see usb_device.h 
        50,                             // Max power consumption in 2X mA(100mA)
        
        //The rest of the configuration descriptor should follow
    </code>

    For more information about remote wakeup, see the following section of
    the USB v2.0 specification available at www.usb.org:

  Summary:
    Transfers a single packed on the USB bus.

  Description:
    Transfers a single packed on the USB bus.

    Typical Usage
    <code>
    //make sure that the last transfer isn't busy by checking the handle
    if(!USBHandleBusy(USBInHandle))
    {
        //Send the data contained in the INPacket[] array out on

  Conditions:
    The user must insure that there isn't currently a transfer pending on the 
    requested endpoint.  This is done by checking the previous request using the
    USBHandleBusy() function (see the typical usage example).

  Input:
    BYTE ep - the endpoint the data will be transmitted on

                This value is either OUT_FROM_HOST or IN_TO_HOST
    BYTE* data - pointer to the data to be sent
    BYTE len - length of the data needing to be sent

  Return Values:
    USB_HANDLE - handle to the transfer.
